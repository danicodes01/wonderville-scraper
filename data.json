Comprised of Liam O'Toole (vocals, fretless & fretted basses), Ben Biber (keyboard, synthesizer, rhythm guitar, vocals), Andrew Garces (lead guitar, engineering), and Josh Cukier (vocals, drums, percussion).</p><p>With roots in Syracuse, New York, The Whether Channel is an emo band that meets zero expectations but hey, you’re reading this. Starting as a joke with the intent to break up after one show, an overwhelming positive response from the Syracuse basement scene convinced founding members Andrew Garces (guitar/vocals) and Rory Stanley (guitar/vocals) to formalize the group. Self-described as “bummer core,\" their innovative combination of metalcore, emo pop, and math rock manifests as passionate and hard hitting songs to scream along to. Garces and Stanley are joined by the excellent rhythm section of JJ Alleyne (drums) and Nikki Tardiff (bass).</p><p>[INSTAGRAM]</p><p>Imperial Motors: @impmo</p><p>Whether Channel: @thewhetherchannelband</p><p>[MUSIC]</p><p>Imperial Motors</p><p>Whether Channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    rsvp</p>",

Their debut EP titled Elevator, described as “full of magic” (Phonograph Me), was independently released in October 2022.

A new EP is forthcoming.</p><p>Zacksmusicbox.bandcamp.com</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/zacksmusicbox?igsh=MXRnM3pncjliaGpocA==</p><p>Starcard</p><p>Their FreakWorld EP, released April last year, evokes Jandek and early 21st century avant garde tape distortion (like something William Basinski would perform). All while retaining pop sensibilities. FreakWorld is a jarring but welcoming listen to anyone who wishes to sit in its charm.</p><p>Starcard.bandcamp.com</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/_starcard?igsh=Z3EzaWNrOHFpMjVh</p><p>Castrated Caligula</p><p>Will Table's heavy Castrated Caligula. Will is more or less a legend in the DIY scene not only in the city but throughout the tri state area. His records with the band Old Table and Climax Landers lend a kitchsy pop quality to them. But for this night, it is his heaviest project, Castrated Caligula that takes the stage. Eat it, Zorn.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/castratedcaligula?igsh=YWJqMXQ5aDgyc3Uy</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/oldtablemusic?igsh=MWNyZzByb3lpcjJveg==\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    RSVP</p>",

We'd love for you to throw some money towards Interzone Agent and Stopping Power having some travel funds though, so a $10 suggested donation would be cool. Doors at 7, music at 8, free indie arcade games all night, and don't forget to tip your bartender well!</p><p>Artificial Scarcity: Bandcamp Instagram</p><p>Interzone Agent: Bandcamp Instagram</p><p>Cendiate: Bandcamp Instagram</p><p>Stopping Power: Bandcamp Instagram</p><p>Cinemartyr: Bandcamp Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    rsvp</p>",
