Ranging from ambient drone to power electronics, you will experience a spectrum of emotion from experimental artists on the east coast.Lineup:Cementation Anxiety (Dark Ambient/Drone/Noise):Hailing from New Jersey's Hudson County, Cementation Anxiety draws influence from the last four decades of ambient, drone, and industrial music—all while channeling the urgency and ethereality of 80’s post-punk and dream-pop. This confluence of sound manifests itself in his dense, yet weightless atmospheres that envelop the listener. The juxtaposition of emotional extremes permeate Cementation Anxiety’s sound—challenging the listener’s position therein. Start with the EP 𝘓𝘪𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘐𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺 from Trust Collective.- Bandcamp-   InstagramSkin Prisoner (Ambient Power Electronics/Harsh Noise):Philadelphia's Skin Prisoner explores emotive extremes with his unique brand of emotional Power Electronics, echoing sentiments of Ramleh's 𝘏𝘰𝘭𝘦 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵 and even Jerome's Dream's catalog. Try his album 𝘚𝘦𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯.- Bandcamp- Instagram: Masoller (Dark Ambient/Gloom Electronics/Noise)DAYMARE STATE GLOOM ELECTRONICS: From Wilkes-Barre, PA, Masoller's stark juxtaposition of dense, inundating atmospheres with bleak, dissonant passages of noise envelop the listener. His full-length 𝘓𝘦𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘘𝘶𝘢𝘳𝘳𝘺 on Cremation Lily's label Strange Rules underscores these sentiments.- Bandcamp- InstagramMorerose (Ambient Harsh Noise/Harsh Noise Wall/Musique Concrète/Electroacoustic):Trauma noise. From Ridgewood, Queens, Morerose's minimal and unrelenting style of harsh noise is patchworked with foreboding electroacoustic movements, cataloging both deeply personal and collective agonies. Fiercely determined to self-release her own work, her 2023 EP Fall Risk was composed almost entirely on an iOS app while in psychiatric inpatient. Her new EP𝘍𝘈𝘊𝘌 𝘏𝘖𝘓𝘌𝘚  is an unsettling interrogation of her lifelong struggle with dermatillomania. VERY MINOR GORE AND NOT MINOR STROBE WARNING.- Bandcamp  - InstagramInfrasubcontra (Ambient/Tuba Drone/Neoclassical):FREELY IMPROVISED, AMPLIFIED, LOW FREQUENCE METALWIND MUSICK: melodic, yet cacophonous, New Jersey's Infrasubcontra (Passaic County) bring a confluence of tuba-driven drone and noisy textures that compel the listener from start to finish. Check out their album 𝘚𝘶𝘯 𝘈𝘮𝘱𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘚𝘪𝘭𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘥 𝘏𝘰𝘳𝘯𝘴 to hear for yourself.- Bandcamp-",
